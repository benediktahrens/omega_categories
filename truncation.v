(** We use the priciple that we should always be doing typeclass resolution on truncation of non-equality types.  We try to change the hypotheses and goals so that they never mention something like [IsTrunc n (_ = _)] and instead say [IsTrunc (S n) _].  If you're evil enough that some of your paths [a = b] are n-truncated, but others are not, then you'll have to either reason manually or add some (local) hints with higher priority than the hint below, or generalize your equality type so that it's not a path anymore. *)
